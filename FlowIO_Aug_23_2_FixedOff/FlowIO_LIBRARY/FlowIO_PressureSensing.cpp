		//a new pressure reading request is made. Now, we don't want to send a request to read all 4 bytes, because the 
		//sensor may still be buzy, so we want to just read the status byte first. And then after we have confirmed that 
		//it is not buzy, then we will send a request to read 4 bytes. Thus, the minimum number of bytes we will actually
		//read will be 5. This takes advantage of the fact that the sensor stops sending data when it sees the stop signal,
		//and then it starts sending data from byte 1 again, when a new read request is made. 
		//(An alternative approach would be to simply request 4 bytes from the start, and if the sensor is busy send another
		//request for 4 bytes. In the case when sensor is not buzy, this saves us from reading status byte twice, but in the
		//case when the sensor is buzy, we are reading the last 3 bytes when we know they are invalid. Thus this approach
		//would be more wasteful.)

		//Request to read the status byte only. Keep reading it until it is not busy.:
